# CTEA
This is a very simple implementation of the Tiny Encryption Algorithm that I used to generate test vectors for other languages. It is meant as closely as possible to resemeble the original code in Needham and Wheeler's original paper "TEA, a Tiny Encryption Algorithm" while remaining correct on modern platforms.

Compiling can be done with:
`gcc main.c; ./a.out`
